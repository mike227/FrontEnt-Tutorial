                    In computer science, an array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or
                    variables), of same memory size, each identified by at least one array index or key. An array is
                    stored such that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical
                    formula.[1][2][3] The simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called one-dimensional
                    array.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, an array of ten 32-bit (4-byte) integer variables, with indices 0 through 9, may be
                    stored as ten words at memory addresses 2000, 2004, 2008, ..., 2036, (in hexadecimal: 0x7D0, 0x7D4,
                    0x7D8, ..., 0x7F4) so that the element with index i has the address 2000 + (i Ã— 4).[4] The memory
                    address of the first element of an array is called first address, foundation address, or base
                    address.

                <p>
                    Because the mathematical concept of a matrix can be represented as a two-dimensional grid,
                    two-dimensional arrays are also sometimes called "matrices". In some cases the term "vector" is used
                    in computing to refer to an array, although tuples rather than vectors are the more mathematically
                    correct equivalent. Tables are often implemented in the form of arrays, especially lookup tables;
                    the word "table" is sometimes used as a synonym of array.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Arrays are among the oldest and most important data structures, and are used by almost every
                    program. They are also used to implement many other data structures, such as lists and strings. They
                    effectively exploit the addressing logic of computers. In most modern computers and many external
                    storage devices, the memory is a one-dimensional array of words, whose indices are their addresses.
                    Processors, especially vector processors, are often optimized for array operations.
