            In programming terminology a variable is a storage area. You store
            things in variables so that you can retrieve them later. Think of
            variables as small boxes. You can write a number on a piece of paper
            then place that piece of paper in a box. Write a label on the box,
            such as "Mom's phone number", and you'll have a quick way to
            identify what kind of information you have stored in the box. One
            day, you might even decide to phone Mom. If so, you can quickly
            locate her phone number by looking at the label on the box and
            pulling out the piece of paper with her number on it.

            In Javascript, when you're setting up a variable you start with the
            letters var (short for variable), or let, or const. (You'll learn
            how to use let and const later in the course. For now, we'll
            concentrate on var.) After a space, you then need to come up with a
            name for your variable. The name can be almost anything you want.
            But there are some important considerations. These:

          <p>
            To store something in a variable, you use an equals symbols ( = ).
            You can store numbers, strings of text and Boolean values in a
            variable. (Boolean values are Yes/No, True/False, 1 or 0.) These
            three, numbers, strings, and Booleans, are called primitive data
            types. As well as the primitive data types you can also store
            objects in variables, objects like the Window, Navigator, and
            Document objects you met earlier.
          </p>
          <p>
            Make sure you end each line with a semicolon ( ; ). Make sure, too,
            that you have a space between var and the variable name. You don't
            actually need a space to the left and right of the equal symbol, but
            it helps to make your code more readable.
